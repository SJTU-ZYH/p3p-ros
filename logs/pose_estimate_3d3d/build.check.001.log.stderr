  By not providing "FindCSparse.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "CSparse", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "CSparse" with any
  of the following names:

    CSparseConfig.cmake
    csparse-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "CSparse" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "CSparse_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "CSparse" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
